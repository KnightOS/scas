Assembler and linker for z80.

## Status

We're finally just about done! All that's needed is a bit more testing before
1.0 proper can be released.

## Compiling from Source

On a UNIX environment, a standard `make && make install` should suffice to
build the software. If on Windows, we recommend setting up a UNIX environment.

Now read `man scas` to learn how to use it.
